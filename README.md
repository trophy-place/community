Public repository for community additions to trophy.place

We currently only support translations, there will be more in the future!

## Translation

The site currently supports the following languages

| Language             | Created by                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| English (US)         | [Mako](https://trophy.place/user/Derpy_Herpy_902) |
| PortuguÃªs Brasileiro | [TheYuriG](https://trophy.place/user/TheYuriG)    |

If you wish to add your own translation, you can do so by either copying the [locales/en-US.yaml](https://github.com/trophy-place/community/blob/main/locales/en-US.yaml) file or visiting the [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CYc1FXg_VJVyd2lrpKriP0_7ujV57iVoYR9ZTKKAcsw/edit#gid=0) and translate it to the language you wish.

If you are using the Google Sheets translation, you can use `ctrl+alt+m` to comment your fields. If your language isn't listed, you can feel free to add it anyway, just make sure to comment the [country code](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-aix/5.1?topic=locale-locales-code-pages-that-are-supported) on the language row. Once you are done contributing, please let us know through the Discord server so we can create the proper PR on this repository and give you the credit and the server role.

If you are contributing through a PR on this repository, there is no need to inform us on Discord as we will get emailed about it. Just make sure to include your PSN ID on the PR so you can get the credit for it and rename the file with your proper [country code](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cobol-aix/5.1?topic=locale-locales-code-pages-that-are-supported) (but using dash `-` instead of underscore `_`).

Once you have worked on a translation, you are eligible for the Site Translator role and can gain access to the site-translation room in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/QkMeChW3Vn).
